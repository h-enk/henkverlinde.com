Hello, I'm Jack, an independent freelance designer and developer, currently based in London.

I'm a big fan of building products that are intuitive and fun, eliminating noise through good code and simple design. Specialising in content management, publishing, e-commerce, live streaming and real-time applications, video and audio, and storytelling.

I've worked with companies such as Air New Zealand, Tesco, News UK, IBM, and The Economist as a developer. Built and lead technology teams at agencies. And built websites for clients such as Beryl and Bullboat. Alongside my client work, I also make my own products such as Unalike.
