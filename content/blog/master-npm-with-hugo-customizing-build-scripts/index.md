In a series of three posts I will introduce you to npm, show you how to manage dependencies, and show you how to customize build scripts. This is the third post of the series.

In the [second post](/master-npm-with-hugo-managing-dependencies/) of the series, I showed you that Hugo itself can be viewed as a dependency of your project, and that a starter theme provides you with full control over your dependencies and gives you the possibility to customize build scripts.

We also extended our basic example with a local Hugo install, a Hugo project structure, and a starter theme structure.

Now weâ€™re ready to talk about how to customize build scripts.

## Add Bootstrap scss

In the first post we installed [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the popular HTML, CSS, and JS library.

## Add PurgeCSS (Hugo's?)

## Wrap up

You can find the example in the [npm-hugo](https://github.com/h-enk/npm-hugo) repo I've set up.
