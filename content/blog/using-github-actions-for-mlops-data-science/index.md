Machine Learning Operations (or MLOps) enables Data Scientists to work in a more collaborative fashion, by providing testing, lineage, versioning, and historical information in an automated way.  Because the landscape of MLOps is nascent, data scientists are often forced to implement these tools from scratch. The closely related discipline of DevOps offers some help, however many DevOps tools are generic and require the implementation of “ML awareness” through custom code. Furthermore, these platforms often require disparate tools that are decoupled from your code leading to poor debugging and reproducibility.
