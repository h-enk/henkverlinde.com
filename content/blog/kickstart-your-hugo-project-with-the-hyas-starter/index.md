When you are kicking off a new Hugo project, you shouldn’t have to start from scratch. Shouldn’t you be able to quickly bootstrap a project, configure it your way, and deploy it? Oh, and bonus points if you can set up SEO, security and performance in the same workflow?

Yep. I think so. That’s why I’ve created the Hugo starter [Hyas](https://gethyas.com/).

## What’s inside Hyas?

Different projects and developers have different requirements, so I've made Hyas super flexible to easily make it your own. Hyas includes:

- Lightweight code base
- 100 scores Google Lighthouse
- A+ scores [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/#source-files) Sass (no JavaScript) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- Check SCSS for errors with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
- Check JavaScript for errors with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Environment specific configuration
- Image shortcode with [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) and blur up
- Fingerprinting and [SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) (production)
- Remove unused CSS (production) with [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss)

See a working example at [hyas.netlify.app](https://hyas.netlify.app/)
