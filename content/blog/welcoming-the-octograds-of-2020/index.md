Class of 2021, you did it! With schools turning to drive through diploma stops and recreating their campus in Minecraft, GitHub Education decided that celebrating this milestone for the next generation of developers would be on us this year. A community celebration to welcome the Class of 2020. Through copper cables, mechanical keyboards, and computers, the graduates and community showed up in an incredible way. Weâ€™re honored to have been a part of the experience.
