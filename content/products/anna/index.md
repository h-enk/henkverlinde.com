Get a fully configured <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> setup for your <a href="https://getdoks.org/">Doks</a> website — with a single command. Choose the options you want on install, or easily customize your setup later.

Your editing experience will even get better, when Forestry will be replaced with <a href="https://tina.io/">Tina</a> (expected mid 2022). Anna will make the switch easy for you.

Make backups of your Forestry setup — with a single command, making sure you'll never loose your customizations.
