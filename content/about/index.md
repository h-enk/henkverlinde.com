Hi, I’m Henk Verlinde, a digital business developer, and the founder and CEO of {{< external-link text="Ventizo" link="https://ventizo.com/" >}}, a digital products company headquartered in the Netherlands.

I hold a MSc in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam. I’ve worked as a business analyst, project manager, and business developer for several international banks. On the side, I’ve always liked to code.

I believe experimenting is key to learn and to grow personally, and professionally. I love making innovative stuff that is simple, easy to use, and looks nice. At Ventizo, and as side projects, I like to create digital products, the {{< external-link text="Jamstack" link="https://jamstack.org/" >}} way.
