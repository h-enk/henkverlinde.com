My main topics of interest are digital business building, startups, and the <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jamstack</a>. In developing products and services, I like embracing an <a href=\"https://www.embeddedentrepreneur.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audience-driven</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/books/testing-business-ideas-david-j-bland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evidence-based</a> approach.


  I hold a Master of Science degree in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam. I have worked as a business analyst, project manager, and business developer for several international banks. Currently, I'm the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://ventizo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ventizo</a>, formerly a digital agency (2010-2020), now a digital products company headquartered in the Netherlands."
