Sullivan includes custom styling for all WooCommerce pages and features, and it also adds a couple of custom ones on top of them. It has search with instant results served over AJAX, dropdown modals for the basket and account settings/login in the header, slideshows on the shop page and blog page, optional sticky menu, a fallback image setting, and much more.

You can read more about Sullivan here, and you can check out the demo installation here. If you want to download it and give it a try, you can find the WordPress.org theme page for it here. You can also install it through the Apperance > Themes > Add New page in your WordPress administration panel.

Special thanks to Bdur604 and acosmin for doing the theme review of Sullivan.
