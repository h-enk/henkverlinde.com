<p class="lead">I’m a designer and developer living in Stockholm. In the daytime, I work on websites and services at the digital agency <a href="https://www.divideconquer.se/en/">Divide & Conquer</a>. In the evenings, I tinker with my own projects, like my <a href="#">free WordPress themes</a>.</p>

I enjoy designing and building things that look nice and work well, whether it’s websites, services or brands. I’ve been fortunate enough to have that be my day job, at the digital agency Divide & Conquer located in Vasastan, Stockholm.
