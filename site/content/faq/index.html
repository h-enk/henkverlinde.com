  <details>
    <summary>What license are your tools under?</summary>
    <p>All of my WordPress themes are released under the <a href="#">GPL 2.0 license</a> – same as WordPress itself. The short summary of what that license entails is that you can do whatever you want with my themes – modify them, rename them, sell them – as long as the end result is also made available under the GPL 2.0 license. There’s a good summary of it on WordPress.org.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Why is your name on my website?</summary>
    <p>You're probably using one of my free WordPress themes, which include a ”Theme by Anders Norén” text in the footer. If you don’t want to include it, you can either remove it with custom CSS or switch to a different theme.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to remove the ”Theme by…” string, I’d appreciate it if you consider sending a small donation my way. You can find the PayPal donation page here.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you help me get in touch with someone who uses one of your themes?</summary>
    <p>No.</p>
