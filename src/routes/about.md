# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Henk Verlinde, founder and CEO of [Ventizo](https://ventizo.com/), a digital products company headquartered in the Netherlands. Founded in 2010, fully owned and run by me. Formerly a digital agency (2010-2020), now a digital product company.

I hold a MSc in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam. Iâ€™ve worked as a business analyst, project manager, and business developer for several international banks. On the side, Iâ€™ve always liked to code.

I believe experimenting is key to learn and to grow personally, and professionally. I love making innovative stuff that is simple, easy to use, and looks nice. At Ventizo, and as side projects, I like to create digital products, the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) way.
