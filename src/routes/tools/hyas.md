## Building on the work of others

Making use of the power of Hugo. Following best practices for performance, SEO and security. Optimized for the Netlify platform. And always flexible, so you can easily make it your own.

## The Hyas kickstart

- Security aware
- Fast by default ⚡️
- SEO-ready
- Development tools (linting, cleaning)
- Bootstrap framework
- Netlify-ready (functions, redirects, headers)

## Great scores
