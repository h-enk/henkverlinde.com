I run [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) on henkverlinde.com. The following information is collected:

I only use the brand of the operating system and don’t include the version number or any other details. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full User-Agent is discarded. For example: _macOS_.
