I'm a product developer, entrepreneur, and technical writer with an M.Sc. [in economics and business] from [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en), Netherlands. My goal is to solve real-world business and technology problems by leveraging business analytics, innovation, and experimentation methods.

My expertise spans business model generation, value proposition design, testing business ideas, design sprints, and web development. My focus is on bridging the gap between theory and delivering practical solutions. Through my work and projects, I've worked on the product development aspects such as:

- Idea generation
- Idea screening
- Concept development and testing
- Business analysis and market strategy
- Product development
- Test marketing
- Product launch

I've helped develop several products [international payments & cash management] for Wholesale Banking clients of [ABN AMRO Bank](https://www.abnamro.nl/en/commercialbanking/corporates-institutionals/index.html) and [ING](https://www.ingwb.com/). I am also the founder and CEO of [Ventizo](https://ventizo.com/), a company that builds digital business tools for technology-driven companies of all sizes.

You will find some of my [project highlights](/projects/) and [writing](/blog/) on this website.
