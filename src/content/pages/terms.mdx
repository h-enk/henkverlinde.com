These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Henk Verlinde personal website (the "Service"). Please read them carefully. This is a personal site, not a business or company website.

## Accepting the Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to all of the Terms, please do not use the Service. If anything is unclear, feel free to contact me by email at _<Email />_.

## Changes to the Terms

I may update these Terms at any time. Changes become effective 2 days after I post the revised Terms (as indicated by the updated date at the top of this page) or immediately if I provide a way for you to accept them (such as a confirmation button). Please check this website for updates.

By continuing to use the Service after changes take effect, you accept the revised Terms.

## Privacy Policy

For details on how I collect and use information about users, please see my [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).

## Third-Party Services

Occasionally, I may provide links to third-party websites or services that I do not own or control. Your use of those sites or services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies. I encourage you to review those documents before using any third-party application, website, or service.

## Creating Accounts

If you create an account or use another service to log in, you are responsible for keeping your password secure and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your data or information provided to the Service.

If you discover or suspect any security breach, please contact me as soon as possible.

The Service may allow you and other users to post, link, or share content. You are responsible for any content you make available, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting or sharing content on the Service, you grant me the right to use, reproduce, modify, publicly perform, display, and distribute your content on or through the Service. I may format your content for display, but will not alter its substance.

You retain all rights to your content except for the limited license granted above. You can remove your content by deleting it. Deleted content will no longer appear on the Service, but copies may remain in backups for a period of time.


You may not post, link, or otherwise make available any of the following on or through the Service:

- Content that is libelous, defamatory, bigoted, fraudulent or deceptive;

- Private information of any third party (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers); and
- Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code.


Additionally, you agree not to do any of the following in connection with the Service or other users:

- Use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service;

## Henk Verlinde Materials

I put a lot of effort into creating this website, including the logo, designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, and other content (excluding your content). This material is owned by me or my licensors and is protected by Dutch and international copyright laws. You may use it for personal, non-commercial purposes only.

Unless I state otherwise, your rights do not include: (i) publicly performing or displaying the Service; (ii) modifying or making derivative works of the Service or any part of it; (iii) using data mining, robots, or similar data gathering methods; (iv) downloading (other than page caching) any part of the Service or its information; (v) reverse engineering or accessing the Service to build a competing product or service; or (vi) using the Service for anything other than its intended purpose. If you do any of these, I may terminate your access.

## Hyperlinks and Third Party Content

You may create a hyperlink to the Service, but you may not use, frame, or enclose any of my trademarks, logos, or other proprietary information without my express written consent.

I make no claim or representation regarding, and accept no responsibility for, third-party websites accessible by hyperlink from the Service or websites linking to the Service. When you leave the Service, these Terms and my policies no longer apply.

I do not review, verify, or authenticate content from users or third parties, and it may include inaccuracies or false information. I make no representations, warranties, or guarantees about the quality, suitability, truth, accuracy, or completeness of any content on the Service. You are solely responsible for and assume all risk from your use of or reliance on any content.

## Unavoidable Legal Stuff

THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" OR "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. I DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE AND CONTENT, WHETHER ALLEGED TO ARISE BY OPERATION OF LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR OTHERWISE.

IN NO EVENT WILL I BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, EVEN IF I HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. MY TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO ME (IF ANY). THIS SECTION APPLIES EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold me harmless from any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees, penalties, and interest) I incur in connection with any claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Service or the use of the Service by anyone using your account, including claims that your use violates any law, regulation, or the rights of any third party, or that you have violated these Terms.

## Copyright Complaints

I take intellectual property rights seriously. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable law, I may terminate access to the Service for users who are deemed to be repeat infringers, at my sole discretion and as appropriate.

## Governing Law

These Terms and all rights, obligations, and relationships under them are governed by the laws of the Netherlands, without regard to conflict of law principles.

## Jurisdiction

You agree that any dispute with the Service or relating to your use of it will be resolved exclusively in the courts of the Netherlands. You also agree not to bring any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against me, and I agree not to bring such actions against you.

## Termination

If you breach any of these Terms, I may suspend or disable your access to the Service.

## Assignment

These Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy are personal to this website and to you as a user. I do not intend to assign or delegate these Terms or the Privacy Policy to anyone else. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms or the Privacy Policy without my prior written consent. Any unauthorized assignment or delegation by you is void.
