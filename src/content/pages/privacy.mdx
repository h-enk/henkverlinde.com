_In addition to this Privacy Policy, Henk Verlinde also has [Terms of Service](/terms/)._

The Henk Verlinde Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of the Henk Verlinde website and services. The laws of the Central Netherlands District Court and the laws of the European Union apply. If you are a resident of the EU/EEA, the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (also referred to as Model Contracts) apply to Trans-Atlantic data transfers.

## General Information

We collect very limited personally identifiable information described below (the “data”) from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) and of those who communicate with us directly via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to provide our services, and to improve the quality of our services, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

- It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the [Terms of Service](/terms/), or as otherwise required by law.
- We transfer information about you if Henk Verlinde is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Henk Verlinde will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Information Gathering and Usage

Henk Verlinde uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication through GitHub, GitLab, services improvement, contact, and research. Henk Verlinde uses personally identifiable information on billing address and/or payment information only for the sole purpose of payment processing for Henk Verlinde services.

Payment processing services enable us to process payments by credit card, bank transfer or other means. To ensure greater security, we share only the information necessary to execute the transaction with the financial intermediaries handling the transaction. Some of these services may also enable the sending of timed messages to our customer, such as emails containing invoices or notifications concerning the payment.
