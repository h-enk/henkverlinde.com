This Privacy Policy explains how I (Henk Verlinde) collect, use, and protect your information when you use my personal website and related services. The laws of the Netherlands and the European Union govern my practices. If you reside in the EU/EEA, the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (Model Contracts) apply to Trans-Atlantic data transfers.

## General Information

I collect only limited personally identifiable information, as described below (the "data"). This includes information from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement), direct email communications, aggregate data on pages visited, and information you voluntarily provide (such as through surveys or registrations). I use this information to deliver and improve the site and its services. I do not share or sell your information to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide services you request, with your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  - Sharing is necessary to investigate, prevent, or act on illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to safety, violations of the [Terms of Service](/terms/), or as required by law.

## Information Gathering and Usage

I use collected information for the following purposes: providing site features, identification and authentication (via GitHub, GitLab), improving the site, contacting users, and research. If you provide billing or payment information (for example, if you donate or support the site), it is used only for processing that transaction.

Payment processing services, if used, allow me to process payments by credit card, bank transfer, or other means. For security, I share only the information necessary to complete transactions with financial intermediaries. Some services may also send messages, such as invoices or payment notifications.

## Personal Site Notice

This website is a personal project and not operated as a business. There are no company shareholders, mergers, or acquisitions. If you have any questions about how your data is handled, please contact me directly.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.

You can manage how websites use cookies through your browser's privacy settings. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of Henk Verlinde websites and applications.

## Data Storage

I use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology needed to operate this site. These partners adhere to the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (Model Contracts).

## Data Retention and Deletion

I retain data only as long as necessary to provide the requested features or services. Some personal data is kept while you are a user of the site. When you delete your account (if applicable), your personal data will be deleted and eventually removed from backups, unless I am legally required or permitted to retain certain data, such as in response to lawful requests from public authorities.

## Rights of Data Subjects

As a data subject, you may request access to, correction, supplementation, or updating of your data. Upon reasonable request, I will remove your data unless laws require me to retain it for a certain period, or if locating and deleting the data would impose a disproportionate financial burden. To request access, correction, or deletion, please email _<Email address="privacy@henkverlinde.com" />_.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have certain rights regarding your personal data. To help you exercise these rights, I provide the following options in your Account Settings (if available):

- Remove Account – delete your account and associated personal data
- Notifications – manage communications you receive from this site

You may also request a copy of your data, or ask for your data to be updated, deleted, restricted, or transferred to another organization.

## Information Sharing

I aim to process as little personal information as possible. For website analytics, I use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which does not use cookies and complies with GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA, and CCPA. With this privacy-friendly software, your IP address is only briefly processed, and I cannot identify you. Under the CCPA, your personal information is de-identified.

I use this software to understand website traffic in the most privacy-friendly way, so I can continually improve the site. My lawful basis under the GDPR is Article 6(1)(f): my legitimate interest in improving the website. No personal data is stored over time.

## Security

I understand the importance of data security. I implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical controls to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction. However, no security measures are 100% effective, and I cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## Links

This website may contain links to third-party websites. I am not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third parties. If you click a third-party link or advertisement, you are leaving this website, and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy. Please review their privacy policies to understand how your data is collected and processed.

## Changes
