I'm the Founder & CEO and Digital Innovation Lead at Ventizo, where I create practical, future-ready digital solutions that empower developers and modern organizations. With a Master of Science (MSc) in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam, I combine analytical insight, technical expertise, and product vision to turn ideas into impact.

Before founding Ventizo, I built my career in international banking as a Business Analyst and Business Developer, helping to design and develop global Payments & Cash Management solutions and investment products. This experience shaped my structured, value-driven approach to innovation.

In 2010, I founded Ventizo as a digital agency focused on helping clients succeed online. For nearly a decade, I partnered with businesses to deliver custom websites, applications, and digital strategies.

Since 2020, I’ve led Ventizo’s shift toward building in-house, open-source products—tools and frameworks designed to give developers and organizations flexible, scalable, and long-lasting solutions. My work centers on innovation with impact, turning ideas into solutions that make real progress possible.
