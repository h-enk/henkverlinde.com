**Thulite Images** is an open-source image optimization tool I created after repeatedly encountering image performance issues in otherwise well-structured projects. Images are often the largest bottleneck, yet managing them tends to introduce unnecessary complexity.

This project explores how far sensible defaults and automation can go without taking control away from developers. The focus is on predictable behavior, minimal configuration, and performance-conscious output.

Rather than hiding complexity behind magic, Thulite Images aims to remain understandable and adaptable as projects evolve.

It's open source and developed as part of the Thulite ecosystem, informed by real-world production use and long-term maintenance through Ventizo.
