**Role:** Creator & Maintainer  
**Focus:** Image performance, responsive media, developer-friendly integrations

## Overview

Thulite Images is the official image-handling integration for Thulite. It brings optimized image loading, responsive sources, and built-in performance defaults — enabling developers and organizations to deliver media-rich content while keeping pages fast, SEO-ready, and accessible.

## Challenge

Websites often face trade-offs when serving images:

- Large images or naive image loading slow down page load times.
- Responsive requirements (different screen sizes, retina displays) require complex srcset and sizes logic.
- Lazy-loading, decoding hints, efficient formats — all add configuration and maintenance overhead.
- Maintaining image quality, SEO, and performance while keeping developer experience smooth is hard.

The goal was to create a seamless image solution for Thulite that handles all these concerns automatically — so developers can focus on content, not performance tuning.

## Solution

Thulite Images solves these challenges with:

- **Smart defaults for performance & loading:** Automatic `srcset`, responsive sizes, lazy-loading, decoding and fetch-priority hints.
- **Flexible resource management:** Support for images as page resources, global resources, or even remote resources — giving developers freedom in how they organize assets.
- **Responsive rendering via shortcodes/partials:** Use simple Markdown syntax or dedicated `img`, `picture`, or `figure` shortcodes/partials — no manual markup required.
- **Progressive image delivery:** Built-in low-quality image placeholder (LQIP) support for blurred-up image previews, improving perceived performance and user experience.
- **Easy integration and configuration:** Install via npm/yarn/pnpm, mount the integration in your configuration, and optionally customize defaults (widths, sizes, loading, decoding, etc.) to suit your project needs.

## Results & Impact

- **Faster page loads:** Images are optimized and delivered efficiently, improving Core Web Vitals and overall site performance.
- **Responsive and high-quality media delivery:** Sites look great on all devices — from mobile to desktop — without manual configuration for each image.
- **Developer-friendly workflow:** No need to write complex markup or manage multiple image versions manually; the integration handles it automatically.
- **Better maintainability:** With a consistent image handling setup built into Thulite, long-term maintenance of media-heavy sites becomes simpler and more reliable.
- **Flexibility across projects:** Works with any Thulite site — blogs, documentation sites, marketing pages, portfolios — regardless of build configuration.

## Key Features

- Quick setup: install via `npm install @thulite/images` (or yarn/pnpm) and mount the integration.
- Use simple Markdown or built-in shortcodes/partials (`img`, `picture`, `figure`) to embed images.
- Automatic responsive `srcset`, `sizes`, and optimized image delivery
- Lazy-loading, decoding, and fetch-priority optimization out of the box
- Low-quality image placeholder (LQIP) support for progressive image loading and better UX
- Flexible resource handling (local page resources, global assets, remote sources)

## Conclusion

Thulite Images brings together performance, flexibility, and developer convenience — transforming image management from a common bottleneck into a seamless part of the development workflow. It embodies the same philosophy as Thulite: practical, future-ready tools that help developers and organizations deliver fast, reliable, and high-quality web experiences.
