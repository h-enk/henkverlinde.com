Images is the official images integration for the [Thulite web framework](/projects/thulite).

## Features

- Render hook for Markdown images
- Shortcodes for `picture`, `img`, and `figure` elements
- Partials for `picture`, `img`, and `figure` elements
- Store your images as a page resource, global resource, or remote resource
- Set defaults for `loading`, `decoding`, `fetchpriority`, and more
- Override defaults locally
- Automatic `sizes` attribute calculation
- Show your images with a _blurred-up LQIP_

## Sensible defaults

Images comes with sensible defaults, but you can customize them in your `params.toml` file.

```toml title="params.toml"
# Images (@thulite/images)
[thulite_images]
  [thulite_images.defaults]
    decoding = "async" # sync, async, or auto (default)
    fetchpriority = "auto" # high, low, or auto (default)
    loading = "lazy" # eager or lazy (default)
    widths = [480, 576, 768, 1025, 1200, 1440] # [640, 768, 1024, 1366, 1600, 1920] for example
    sizes = "auto" # 100vw (default), 75vw, or auto for example
    process = "" # "fill 1600x900" or "fill 2100x900" for example
    lqip = "16x webp q20" # "16x webp q20" or "21x webp q20" for example
```

## Configurable

Images is highly configurable. You can set defaults for all images, override them locally, and use the `process` parameter your images need.

## Full documentation
