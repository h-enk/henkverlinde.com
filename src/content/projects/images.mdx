**Thulite Images** is an official image performance integration for the Thulite web framework, designed to help developers deliver fast, optimized images with minimal effort.

With easy configuration and support for images as page, global, or remote resources, Thulite Images makes it simple to enhance your site's visuals while keeping performance and best practices at the forefront. Whether you're building blogs, portfolios, or documentation sites, this integration helps ensure images load efficiently and look great across devices.
