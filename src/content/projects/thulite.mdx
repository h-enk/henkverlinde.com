## Overview

Thulite is a modern web framework designed to combine the speed and reliability of static-site generation with the flexibility of contemporary development stacks. It enables developers and organizations to build fast, secure, and SEO-optimized websites efficiently.

Launched as an open-source project, Thulite reflects a decade of experience in building digital products and frameworks that prioritize performance, scalability, and usability.

## Challenge

Many teams and individuals face trade-offs when building modern websites:

- **Universal deployment**: Projects can be deployed on Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting platform.

## Results / Impact

- **Faster development**: Developers can scaffold fully functional websites quickly with minimal setup.
- **Consistent performance**: Sites built with Thulite deliver optimized page speed and reliability out of the box.
