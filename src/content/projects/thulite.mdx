**Thulite** is an open-source web framework I created to explore a simpler, more sustainable way of building modern websites. It's shaped by years of working on content-heavy and long-lived projects where performance, clarity, and maintainability matter more than trends.

Rather than chasing abstraction, Thulite focuses on solid defaults, clear structure, and web standards. It's built on Hugo for speed and reliability, with an npm-based workflow where it genuinely adds value—without turning tooling into the product.

The project is intentionally opinionated, prioritizing maintainability over cleverness and predictability over flexibility. The goal is to provide a calm foundation that developers can understand, adapt, and trust over time.

Thulite is open source and actively maintained. Commercial development and long-term support are handled through Ventizo, while the framework itself remains community-friendly.
