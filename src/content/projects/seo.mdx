**Role:** Creator & Maintainer  
**Focus:** SEO, metadata, structured data, social sharing optimizations

## Overview

Thulite SEO is the official SEO integration for the Thulite web framework. It provides a full set of SEO features — meta tags, structured data, social sharing support, sitemap and robots generation — so developers and organizations can launch SEO-ready, high-performance websites with minimal configuration.

## Challenge

When building static or modern websites, developers often face multiple SEO-related challenges:

- Manually managing meta tags (title, description, canonical URLs) across many pages is error-prone.
- Structured data (JSON-LD schemas for website, articles, breadcrumbs, etc.) is complex to implement consistently.
- Social media previews (Open Graph, Twitter cards) require additional configuration for proper sharing.
- Maintaining SEO, sitemaps, robots rules, favicons, and correct sharing metadata across multiple content types introduces significant overhead.
- For documentation sites, blogs, landing pages or content-heavy websites, losing SEO/interoperability benefits because of missing or inconsistent metadata.

The goal was to create an integration that removes these burdens by offering sensible defaults, easy configuration, and support for common SEO and social-sharing requirements out of the box.

## Solution

Thulite SEO solves these challenges by offering:

- **Automatic meta tags:** Title, description, canonical URLs, robots directives, alternate-language links, all easily configurable.
- **Social sharing optimization:** Open Graph and Twitter/X cards support — giving pages proper title, description, and images for social previews.
- **Structured data (JSON-LD) support:** Schema options including Website, Organization/Person, BreadcrumbList, Article, BlogPosting, NewsArticle, Product — ensuring content is machine-readable and SEO-friendly.
- **Auxiliary features:** Automatic favicon generation from a single source image, sitemap generation, robots.txt configuration — reducing manual asset management and SEO setup.
- **Simple installation and integration:** Install via npm / pnpm / yarn (e.g. `npm install @thulite/seo@latest`), then configure basic settings or override metadata per page — giving flexibility and ease of use.

## Results & Impact

- **SEO-ready sites from the start:** Developers can launch sites with proper metadata, structured data, social sharing support, and sitemap/robots — without extra manual setup.
- **Improved visibility & shareability:** Pages are structured for search engines and social platforms, leading to better indexing and cleaner social previews.
- **Less overhead, more consistency:** With defaults and templates handled by the integration, maintenance becomes easier and mistakes are less likely.
- **Flexible across content types:** Whether you're building a documentation site, blog, marketing page, or product site — SEO works out of the box without special configuration.
- **Future-proof setup:** As content scales or evolves, SEO configuration remains maintainable and extendable via the integration's schema and metadata options.

## Key Features  

- Easy install: `npm install @thulite/seo@latest` (or pnpm / yarn)
- Automatic metadata: titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, robots, alternate languages
- Open Graph & Twitter/X card support for social sharing
- JSON-LD structured data: Website, Organization/Person, BreadcrumbList, Article/BlogPosting/NewsArticle/Product schemas
- Sitemap generation, robots.txt, and favicon generation from a single source icon image
- Page-level overrides via front-matter, for full control per page
