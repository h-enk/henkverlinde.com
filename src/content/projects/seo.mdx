**Thulite SEO** is an open-source project born from a recurring frustration: SEO fundamentals are often either overlooked or over-engineered. Most sites don't need advanced tooling, but they do need consistent metadata and sensible defaults.

This project focuses on handling those basics correctly and predictably, without turning SEO into a separate system or configuration burden.

The design prioritizes standards-based output, maintainability, and transparency. Its goal is to reduce accidental mistakes, not promise ranking shortcuts.

Thulite SEO is open source and maintained alongside the Thulite framework, with commercial development and long-term support provided through Ventizo.
