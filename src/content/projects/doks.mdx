**Doks** is an open-source documentation theme I built after working on documentation sites that needed to scale over time—both in content and contributors. Too often, documentation fails due to poor structure, slow performance, or tooling that becomes hard to maintain.

Doks focuses on clarity, accessibility, and predictable organization. It's designed to support writers and developers alike, without locking teams into rigid systems or unnecessary complexity.

The project is opinionated where it helps, emphasizing content structure, usability, and performance by default. Visual simplicity is intentional, keeping the focus on readable, durable documentation.

Doks is open source and actively maintained as part of the broader Thulite ecosystem, with long-term development supported through Ventizo.
