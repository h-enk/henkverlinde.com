**Thulite Inline SVG** is a small open-source utility I built to make working with inline SVGs more consistent and maintainable. Across projects, SVGs often became a source of duplicated markup, accessibility issues, or performance overhead.

This project focuses on clean reuse, explicit markup, and predictable output—without abstraction layers that hide what's happening.

It's intentionally narrow in scope, designed to solve a specific problem well and remain easy to understand.

Thulite Inline SVG is open source and maintained as part of the Thulite ecosystem, complementing other tools focused on performance and long-term quality.
