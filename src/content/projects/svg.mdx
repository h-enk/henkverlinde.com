**Role:** Creator & Maintainer  
**Focus:** Inline SVG support, optimized vector graphics, developer-friendly asset workflows

## Overview

Thulite Inline SVG is the official SVG integration for the Thulite framework. It enables developers to embed, style, and manage SVG assets directly in HTML — delivering scalable vector graphics with full control over accessibility, styling, and performance.

## Challenge

When using SVGs in web projects, developers often run into several issues:

- Embedding SVGs as images (`<img>`) limits styling and scalability, and often prevents fine-grained control over colors, states, or CSS-based interactions.
- Managing responsive SVGs or sprites for icons and logos can become cumbersome and error-prone.
- Ensuring accessibility (with titles, descriptions, ARIA attributes) while keeping markup clean and maintainable is often overlooked.
- Without inline support, SVGs may end up as external assets — harder to version, modify, or integrate with build pipelines and theming systems.

The goal was to create a seamless, developer-friendly way to integrate SVGs in Thulite projects — combining flexibility, maintainability, performance, and accessibility.

## Solution

Thulite Inline SVG addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Native inline SVG support:** Install via `npm install @thulite/inline-svg`, then embed SVGs directly in HTML templates or Markdown using Hugo-based templates — giving full control over SVG markup and styling.
- **Flexible asset management:** SVGs can be managed as part of the project's asset pipeline — benefiting from version control, theming, and build tooling just like other web assets.
- **Styling and theming control:** Inline SVG markup means you can style shapes, paths, fills, strokes — adapt icons or illustrations to themes, color schemes, or dark/light mode using CSS or SCSS.
- **Accessibility and semantics:** Support for `title`, `desc`, `role`, ARIA labels, and proper attribute handling — ensuring SVGs remain accessible and semantically correct for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Performance and optimization-friendly:** SVGs remain vector, lightweight, and scalable without multiple raster variants; inlining avoids extra HTTP requests and simplifies asset delivery. This aligns with Thulite's overarching mission of performance and simplicity.

## Results & Impact

- **Full control over graphics:** Developers and designers can now treat SVGs like code — versioned, themeable, and fully stylable — rather than as static image assets.
- **Simplified icon and asset workflow:** Icons, logos, and illustrations can be embedded directly — no need for sprite sheets or complex build scripts.
- **Better accessibility and semantics:** Inline SVGs allow for semantic markup and accessible metadata (titles/descriptions), improving UX for assistive tool users.
- **Consistent performance and maintainability:** Site graphics remain lightweight and scalable; artwork is easier to maintain over time since SVG code stays in the repo.
- **Seamless integration with Thulite ecosystem:** Works alongside other Thulite integrations (like Images, SEO, themes) — giving a unified stack for building high-quality, modern websites.

## Key Features

- Installable via npm: `npm install @thulite/inline-svg@latest`
- Inline embedding in HTML / Hugo templates or Markdown — full control over markup and attributes
- Support for accessibility metadata (title, description, ARIA attributes)
- Compatible with Thulite themes and build pipelines — works out-of-the-box with popular integrations and static-site workflows

## Conclusion

Thulite Inline SVG embodies the core philosophy behind Thulite: practical, performant, and developer-focused tools that make everyday web development safer, easier, and more powerful. By enabling inline SVG support with accessibility, theming, and build integration, it turns vector graphics from a “nice-to-have” into a managed, maintainable part of any modern website built with Thulite.
